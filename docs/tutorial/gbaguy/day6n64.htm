<h2 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>See Screen, See Pic On Screen</b></h2>
<p style="color: green;"><pre><b>
	Today we'll put a picture on the screen.

<h3 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>First</b></h3>
	Make a 320x240 bitmap in MSPaint, save in C:\n64asm\ as pic.bmp.
Next, goto <a href="http://www.dextrose.com/">Dextrose</a> and download the
patch to the GroundZero Devkit, what we want is the BMP2N64 program. Copy
BMP2N64.exe to your n64 assembly folder. Open a DOS Prompt and type:

cd <i>your assembly folder path</i>
bmp2n64 -in:pic.bmp -out:pic -label:pic -16

Two files should be created, you can delete the .H file, but keep the .S file.
The .S File may work as is, but I recommend you delete the lines before
the label and replace all ".half"s with "dh" (no quotes).

<h3 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>The Code</b></h3>

	The code for this isn't that much different than we've seen before
or that you could have come up with on your own. So here we go (the whole thing):

;;---CODE START---;;
	org $80000400 ; starting point

	li   t1,8         ; crash protection
        lui    t0,$bfc0   ; I still don't know what this specifically does.
        sw   t1,$07fc(t0)

        la   t0,$A4400000  ; start of VI regs. ; this block initializes Video
        li   t1, $103002
        sw   t1,0(t0)
        la   t1,$a0200000 ; the frame buffer address
        sw   t1,4(t0)
        li   t1,320
        sw   t1,8(t0)
        li   t1,$2
        sw   t1,12(t0)
        li   t1,$0
        sw   t1,16(t0)
        li   t1,$3e52239
        sw   t1,20(t0)
        li   t1,$0000020d
        sw   t1,24(t0)
        li   t1,$00000c15
        sw   t1,28(t0)
        li   t1,$0c150c15
        sw   t1,32(t0)
        li   t1,$006c02ec
        sw   t1,36(t0)
        li   t1,$002501ff
        sw   t1,40(t0)
        li   t1,$000e0204
        sw   t1,44(t0)
        li   t1,$200
        sw   t1,48(t0)
        li   t1,$400
        sw   t1,52(t0)

	li t0,0xa0200000
	li t3,2
	la t2,MKImage ; MKImage should be the label in your .S file
	li t1,320*240*2-2
drawImage:
	lh t4,0(t2)
	sh t4,0(t0)   ; there's probably a better way, but oh well :)
	add t2,t2,t3
	add t0,t0,t3
	sub t1,t1,t3  ; there's a better place for this that'll be discussed later
	bnez t1,drawImage

infin:
	nop
	j infin

	include MKImage.S ; MKImage.S should be the filename of your .S File
;;---CODE STOP---;;

	I hope you take the time to understand code and not just rip it :)!

	Until Next Time!,
