	Today is going to be all about the math instructions ADD and SUB.

<h3 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>The ADD Instruction</b></h3>
	Now, reel in the fish slowly! Oops, ADD means ADDition, not Attension Deficit Disorder!
What was I thinking!.

	Ok, now that the bad joke is out of the way, ADD works like this:
		ADD t1,t2,t3  ; t1 = t2 + t3; is just about the simplest way I can describe it.

	I've also seen:
		ADD t1, 2 ; which is supposed to be t1 += 2, appearantly. THIS DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK!
		; alot of the time, an assembler either errors or interprets this as t1 += V0
	
	Which brings me to another point, a register's (in some assemblers) number can be used
instead it it's t1,v0,a3 style name. See Nemu's debugger for as far as I know, is the correct order.

<h3 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>The SUB Instruction</b></h3>
	INSERT BAD JOKE ABOUT SubWay HERE.

	The SUB Instruction works like so:
		SUB t0,t4,t5 ; t0 = t4 - t5; There's a chance I might have t4 and t5 in the wrong order,
		; but I think I have it right.

	The "I've also seen" comment applies to SUB as well.

<h3 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>The MUL/DIV Instruction</b></h3>
	The MUL and DIV Instructions work like this (as far as I can tell):

		MUL t0,t2,t4 ; t0 = t2 * t4;

		DIV t1,t0,t6 ; t1 = t0 / t6;

	Also note that all these math instructions use signed numbers.

<h3 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>Comparison/Branch Instructions</b></h3>
	This would have been shorter than I wanted it to be, so I'll have to talk about Comparison/Branch Instructions
also.

	The first instruction we'll learn is BNEZ, BNEZ is a psuedo-instruction that only Anarko's assembler doesn't
support (along with LA). BNEZ is used like so:

	bnez t1, LABEL ; IF t1 not equal zero THEN GOTO LABEL

For assemblers that don't support it, use:

	bne t1,$0,LABEL ; same as above, note that $0 is the special CPU register that is permanently zero.

The other use for BNE (no Z) is:

	bne t1,t3,LABEL ; IF t1 not equal t3 THEN GOTO LABEL

There is also:

	beq t1,t3,LABEL ; IF t1 == t3 THEN GOTO LABEL

	blt t0,t1,LABEL ; IF t0 less than t1 THEN GOTO LABEL

	bgt t0,t1,LABEL ; IF t0 greater then t1 THEN GOTO LABEL

	ble t2,t4,LABEL ; IF t2 less or = to t4 THEN GOTO LABEL

	bge t2,t4,LABEL ; IF t2 greater or = to t4 THEN GOTO LABEL

Add a U to the end of the instruction (like BGEU) to compare unsigned numbers.

<h3 align="center" style="color: LightCoral;"><b>This Day In Review</b></h3>

	Tomorrow, we'll either learn another set of instructions, or we'll do
something else (maybe a pic on screen)!

	Until Next Time!,
